# ProjectZomboidMod
A repo to document my learning of a Project Zomboid Mod Development

Do note this current mod is for development of Build 42, specifically Build 42.13.2, which at current is in an unstable state. I plan on making this mod multiplayer friendly so this might be a smorgasbord of mod ideas all thrown into one mod.
This mod will also be coded in LUA, while Java would be "better" in a sense as its more "open" compared to LUA, the Steam Workshop doesn't accept Java mods - I believe this is down to .jar technically being execution files.

The plan is to iterate through modding development and potentially help new modders out as they will be able to look through all the Pushes to figure out what has been done.
The first push is going for be the folder setup in C:\Users\[User]\Zomboid\Workshop


Some knowledge points:
Zomboid Workshop folder: C:\Users\[User]\Zomboid\Workshop
  This is where we will actually be making our mods
  Note that the "mods" folder found in the same directory is for manually adding mods to the game, this is mainly for the use of Java based mods
